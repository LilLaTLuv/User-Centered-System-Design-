## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a strategic initiative to enhance the efficiency and user experience of A&D University Food Services by implementing a digital pre-ordering system accessible via a dedicated mobile application and website. Recognizing the critical interplay between technology and its users, this project necessitates a thorough investigation into the human-computer interaction (HCI) aspects for both student users and food service staff. By employing user-centered design methodologies, including surveys, observational studies, and interviews, we aim to develop an intuitive and effective system that optimizes operational workflows, improves student satisfaction, and ultimately contributes to a more streamlined and modern campus experience. This proposal details the rationale, proposed research methodology, key considerations for system development, and anticipated benefits of this initiative.

## 1. Introduction

A&D University Food Services seeks to optimize its operational efficiency and enhance the convenience offered to its student and faculty population. To achieve this, we propose the development and deployment of a digital pre-ordering system for cafeteria meals. This system will empower users to browse menus, place orders in advance, and facilitate a more seamless meal acquisition process. The success of this initiative hinges on the effective human-computer interaction (HCI) between the system and its end-users: the students who will utilize the ordering interface and the food service staff who will manage and fulfill these orders.

## 2. Understanding the User Ecosystem: A Human-Centered Approach

The implementation of a new digital system necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the needs, behaviors, and existing workflows of its primary users. In this context, our target demographics are the student body and the food service staff.

### 2.1 Student Users

Students, as the primary consumers of the food services, will directly interact with the proposed application and website. Their adoption and satisfaction will be crucial determinants of the system's success. To effectively cater to their needs, a thorough understanding of their current habits, preferences, and technological proficiencies is required. Key areas of investigation include:

* Current Technology Usage
* Expectations and Preferences
* Current Cafeteria Experience

### 2.2 Food Service Staff

The successful integration of a digital ordering system into the existing operational framework is contingent upon its usability and efficiency for the food service staff. Understanding their current workflows, technological infrastructure, and communication practices is paramount. Key areas of investigation include:

* Current Order Processing Procedures
* Existing Technology Infrastructure
* Workflow Challenges and Bottlenecks
* Information Management

## 3. Research Methodology: Employing User-Centered Design Principles

To gain the necessary insights into the user ecosystem, we propose a multi-faceted research approach grounded in HCI principles:

* Student Surveys
* Observational Studies
* Staff Interviews
* Usability Testing (Iterative)

## 4. Key Considerations for System Development

Based on the user research and HCI principles, the development of the digital ordering system should prioritize the following:

* Usability and Intuitive Design
* Efficiency and Workflow Integration
* Feature Prioritization
* Scalability and Maintainability
* Security and Data Privacy

## 5. Proposed System Architecture

We propose the development of a new, integrated system comprising:

* Mobile Application (iOS and Android)
* Web Interface
* Staff Management Interface
* Integration with Existing Systems (Optional)

## 6. Anticipated Benefits

The implementation of a user-centered digital ordering system is expected to yield significant benefits for A&D University Food Services and its users:

* Enhanced Efficiency
* Improved Student Satisfaction
* Data-Driven Decision Making
* Reduced Errors
* Modernized Campus Experience
* Potential for Personalized Experiences

## 7. Conclusion

By embracing a user-centered approach and investing in a well-designed digital ordering system, A&D University Food Services has a significant opportunity to enhance its operational efficiency, elevate the student experience, and modernize its service delivery. The proposed research methodology will provide the critical insights necessary to develop a system that is both effective for staff and intuitive for students. We are confident that this initiative will result in a more streamlined, efficient, and user-friendly food service environment for the entire university community.

## Executive Summary

This proposal addresses critical usability and design limitations within the existing A&D University class registration system. While the fundamental registration process may be perceived as straightforward, its overall execution suffers from a lack of user-centered design principles, leading to a clunky and suboptimal user experience. This document outlines specific areas for improvement, focusing on enhancing the login interface and the post-login navigation and information presentation. By implementing user-centered design methodologies, we aim to create a more intuitive, efficient, and visually appealing system that empowers students to manage their academic schedules effectively.

## 1. Introduction

The current A&D University class registration system, while functional, presents several usability challenges that detract from the overall user experience. These issues, ranging from the initial login process to the navigation and information display within the system, can lead to student frustration and inefficiency. This proposal identifies key areas requiring immediate attention and proposes user-centered design enhancements to create a more seamless and intuitive registration experience.

## 2. Analysis of Existing System Usability Deficiencies

Our initial assessment of the existing class registration system reveals several critical usability issues that warrant immediate remediation:

### 2.1 Login Interface Deficiencies

* Lack of Professional Design and Visual Appeal
* Insufficient User Guidance
* Ambiguous Input Fields
* Suboptimal Font Size

### 2.2 Post-Login Navigation and Information Presentation Issues

* Inefficient Navigation Structure
* Lack of Clear Information Identifiers
* Suboptimal Schedule Visualization

## 3. Proposed User-Centered Design Enhancements

To address the identified usability deficiencies, we propose the following user-centered design enhancements:

### 3.1 Login Interface Redesign

* Enhanced Visual Design
* Integrated Help Center Access
* Clear Input Field Labeling and Iconography

### 3.2 Post-Login Navigation and Information Presentation Improvements

* Implementation of a Persistent Global Navigation Menu
* Clear Identification of Course Action Indicators
* Enhanced Schedule Visualization

## 4. Benefits of Implementing User-Centered Design

Adopting a user-centered design approach and implementing the proposed enhancements will yield significant benefits:

* Improved User Experience
* Increased Efficiency
* Reduced Support Requests
* Enhanced Accessibility
* Professional Representation

## 5. Conclusion

The current A&D University class registration system, while fundamentally functional, can be significantly improved by adopting a user-centered design philosophy. Addressing the identified deficiencies in the login interface, navigation structure, and information presentation will lead to a more intuitive, efficient, and satisfying experience for students. By implementing the proposed enhancements, A&D University can demonstrate its commitment to user-centricity and provide a modern and effective platform for managing academic endeavors.
